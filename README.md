# üç£ Modern Sushi-Themed Website
This is a simple static website made using only HTML, CSS and JS.

## üîç Overview
The website was made based around the use of CSS variables. A well organized folder structure was achieved by using multiple CSS files for each section of the site, 
with a further improved readability by making use of the BEM naming method. This project served to practice the principles of writing clean code.
